# [DRAFT VERSION, still IN PROGRESS...]
## Ainstein-video-sources

### Well, what is this all about:

Several mounth ago, I've started working on personalized learning assistant called [Ainstein](m.me/ainsteinio?ref=github).

Ainstein is a FB chatbot that provides __curated__ online courses and tutorials on the topics like (but not limited to):
 - Web development
 - Startups

The idea of Ainstein is to keep our knowldage up to date, buy pushing a smart messages with a short 10/15/ minutes 

It includes __free__ materials from different sources, such as: _Eggheads_, _Treehouse_ and _YouTube_. In fact, _Treehouse_ is not really free.

### What is the idea behind this repo:

My intention was to create a _little friend_ called Ainstein for each and everyone who want's to learn and keep her/his knowladge up-to-date, in a more funny and not really time bounding way. So, you set a goal of how much time you want to spend on learning daily and we start from here.

### Challenge which I'd to solve together with community:

Curating the best materials on the web is a hard problem and one way to solve it is to apply different kind of ML/AI algorithms etc. But, this problem can be solved even in a better way. This way is to involve YOU and your own expirience with learning online.

I strongly believe that community can drive this idea and help all people out there that want's to become an improve knowladge or start learning in a free and efficient way.

### We have some foundings:

Ainstein is an official member of [FBStart](https://developers.facebook.com/fbstart) program from Facebook.

__It give as $40,000 in free services and tools.__

And I would like to involve as much people as I can to use this money in a smart way, so we can bring a value to the people.
I'd like to OPEN SOURCE Ainstein and give it a free fly driven by community only.

### We need contributors:

To become a contributor you __don't have to be__ a rock start or genius. You just share with us the best FREE tuts and videos on the web and if they mature enough, they gonna be merged and deployed to Ainstein, so other people can benefit from your contribution.

### We need repo maintainers:

To become a repo maintainer, you have to be mature and ideally driving your own tutorials. 

A good example:
